## Purpose
This is a collection of MIPS programs that were used to aid me in my understanding of assembly language concepts. Each file contains a short dscription of the program's purpose and what it is trying to accomplish. Some of these exercises were in-class assignments, and others were programs with which I wanted to experiment. Although MIPS is almost unheard of today, I believe it is still a great learning tool for learning about computer architectures and how hardware functions at a lower level. Programs range from simple array creation, to creating functions and utilizing the stack for such a task. There is a program in this collection that translates C++ code into MIPS. I hope you enjoy. If you find this repository and you have questions, feel fre to make suggestions and/or open up an issue.
## How to Run
In order to run these programs, you can download the Mars simulator from [here.](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/MARS_4_5_Aug2014/Mars4_5.jar)
If Java is installed on the system, execute the following command:
java -jar Mars.jar sample.asm
